# 📊 Student Data Analysis - PBL Project

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance data in India using Python. The objective is to identify trends, visualize insights, and build predictive logic based on the dataset.

---


## 📈 Features

- 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- 📊 Multiple visualizations of academic performance factors
- 🤖 Simple prediction logic implemented in `predit3.py`
- 📂 Well-organized notebook and CSV for transparency and reproducibility

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stanalysis-pbl-main.git  
   cd Stanalysis-pbl-main

2. **Install dependencies**  
   *(Recommended: Use a virtual environment)*  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
> **Note:** If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install common libraries:
> bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run analysis

Open analysisreport.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to view and interact with the full data analysis.

Run predit3.py to test prediction logic via script.

**📊 Visual Insights**
All visualization plots generated during analysis are stored in the plots/ folder, such as:

- Score distributions

- Gender and region-wise performance

- Subject-wise comparison

- Trend lines and predictions

**📄 Dataset**
File: modified_student_data_india.csv

Contains academic performance data (marks, categories, demographics, etc.) of students in India.

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for direct use in analysis.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
- Python 3.x

- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

- Basic ML logic (in script)
